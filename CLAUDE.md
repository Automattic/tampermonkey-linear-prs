We're working on linear-github-pr tampermonkey script.

We would like this script to add the following links to the bottom of the GH PR description (the same way as jetpack-live-branches.js does that).
:
- Add to Linear: the link that generates linear intent (described below) which takes the title of the PR, and the description of the PR, and opens the linear.new intent.


This is the page with explicit information on how to use linear.new intent structure which we would like to create:
https://linear.app/developers/create-issues-using-linear-new
